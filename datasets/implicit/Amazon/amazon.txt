The 10GB $T$ is already pre-loaded with almost 5GB of software and sample mp3's, so I would highly recommend upgrading to at least a 20 GB drive.

The $T$ with the preinstalled 256MB Ram is a little too slow for my taste, but after installing a 512MB/PC-133 dimm to bump me up to 640MB, I am cruzing at lightening speeds.
