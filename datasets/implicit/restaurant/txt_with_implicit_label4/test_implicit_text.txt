The best dessert, a $T$, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.

I was especially impressed during the bday party when the $T$ went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.
