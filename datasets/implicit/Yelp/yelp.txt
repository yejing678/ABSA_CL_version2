I tried the $T$, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok.

The fact that none of the $T$ match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.

I have no idea who gave this $T$ high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked.

Now for the complaints - the $T$ is incredibly rude and pretentious, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, the tables are too close together, the decor is gaudy and the food will burn a hole in your mouth going in and going out.

You can wait a long time for a $T$, so be prepared to wait, but if you go during off times, like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you shouldn't have a wait.
